## Do you like it? Star it!

If you use this component just star it. A developer is more motivated to improve a project when there is some interest. My other [Active Admin components](https://github.com/blocknotes?utf8=âœ“&tab=repositories&q=activeadmin&type=source).

Or consider offering me a coffee, it's a small thing but it is greatly appreciated: [about me](https://www.blocknot.es/about-me).
